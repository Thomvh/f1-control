# f1-control

To install f1-control on your f1-gce server (which should be setup on your @gmail account because it's free and you never want it to go away)

1. `cd /opt`

2. `sudo git clone https://github.com/zenjabba/f1-control`

3. `sudo f1-control/configure-gce.sh "email address of GCE instance your want to run your mover instances in"`

    The email address should be the email you have the free $300 credit on, and should be fully configured waiting for new instances
